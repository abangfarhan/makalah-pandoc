# Pandoc Template for Makalah

This repo contains the template to create a makalah in the format that I usually
used in my university. The template is actually just a modified version of the
default, which I generated by executing `pandoc -D latex`. I have also created
additional variables to be used by the template, which should be assigned from
the `metadata.yaml` file, such as the `university`, `faculty`, `city`, `subject`
(mata kuliah), `lecturer` (dosen pengampu), `soa` (whether you want to include a
statement of authorship at the beginning or not, the format of which is defined
inside the template), and `pengantar`, which should contains all paragraphs to
be included as the kata pengantar.

At the moment, the template can only be used for Indonesian language, since some
of the words defined in the template are Indonesian (such as "Kata Pengantar",
the whole "Pernyataan Keaslian", etc.).

A preview of the pdf file can be seen at the `makalah-preview.pdf` file.

# Building the File

To build the pdf file, if you have a make program installed, you just need to
run `make` in this directory. If not, you can just execute this from your
command line:

```
pandoc -o makalah.pdf makalah.md metadata.yaml --template=template.tex --top-level-division=chapter
```

Or, alternatively you can also just execute the `Makefile.cmd` file from this
repo.
